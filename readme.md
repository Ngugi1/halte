#TV output to Arduino using VA component
This project aims at displaying graphics for GPS and position on vehicle screens
##Challenges
1. The lack of direct control of the screen object
2. Low resolution of the obtained output
3. Problem displaying modern image formats such as jpeg and png
4. More extensive hardware to get the parts workings

Although this system is rather simple, it has the above forementioned challenges that make it hard to push further

## Recomendations
1. Use higher processing power for displays
2. Use modern interfaces such as HDMI for the output
3. Provide more utility on the screen, data and adverts
